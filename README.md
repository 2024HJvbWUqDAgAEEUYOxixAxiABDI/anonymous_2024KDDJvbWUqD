This anonymous repository contains some important illustrative figures for rebuttal. 

The code will be uploaded soon. Thanks!

### Why can't the Lorentz Transformation by Chen et.al [10] preserve the relative distance and how can the proposed method do so?

We have provided a more detailed explanation of the code and easy-to-understand math language. If you need further clarification, you can check out the following link:
